\subsection{Problem}
Lines and Planes (26) : Find the slope of the line, which makes an angle of $30^o$ of $y-axis$ measured anti clockwise.
\subsection{Solution}
If $\theta$ is the angle measured with respect to $x-axis$ anti clockwise to a straight line, then Slope of that line is $\tan\theta$.\\[6pt]

Let a straight line passing through origin makes an angle of $30^o$ of $y-axis$ measured anti clockwise\\[6pt]
then\\[6pt]
$\theta = 90^o + 30^o = 120^o$\\[6pt]
$\therefore$ Slope of the line $=\tan 120^o = -\sqrt{3} $
